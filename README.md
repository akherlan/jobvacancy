## Semi-automatic Job Vacancies Worker

**For Telegram Channel and Personal Chat Feeder**

For convenience then not go back and forth check job vacancies websites.

Data source:

- Glints
- Jobstreet
- Indeed (coming soon)

### Work flow

- Sorting the job vacancies
- Formatting content of post: title, description, URL
- Sending content to personal chat (admin) for supervision
- Forwarding post to a Telegram channel

### Motivation

Initially, I wanted to make a bot that works 24/7 to forward job vacancies from [Telegram group](https://t.me/gnurindonesia/) to separate them to [Telegram channel](https://t.me/gnuridjobs/ ) special. But in the end, this plan was saved for long-term plans only with functions that might be enriched, a.k.a not only for storing job vacancies on the Channel. However, it seems that groups don't really need to have auto-forward feature messages to channels, at least for now. Maybe if later there is a feature short course in Telegram (kuliah Telegram) that is suitable and can be very useful.

Let's take this bot as a worker only for a semi-automatic tool forward to channels from various sources. The task of Admin to keep an eye on messages is still needed. Humans are always better.

### To Do

-   [ ] Post feature enrichment: full/part-time? is remote? tag?
